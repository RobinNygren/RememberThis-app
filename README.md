## üîë Key Components and Utilities

### Push Notifications

Push notifications are managed via `expo-notifications`. Key functions are implemented in the file `utils/notifications.ts`:

- **`registerForPushNotificationsAsync`**: Requests permissions to enable push notifications.
- **`scheduleNotification`**: Schedules notifications based on the specified task time and date.

---

### Navigation

The app utilizes `React Navigation` to handle seamless navigation between views:

- **Drawer Navigator**: Provides a side menu for accessing major features such as task addition and calendar view.
- **Bottom Tabs Navigator**: Enables quick navigation between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly task categories.

---

### Context and Reducers

- **`TasksContext`**: A global state management solution for handling task-related data across the app.
- **`tasksReducer`**: Processes actions like adding, editing, and deleting tasks to update the global state efficiently.

---

### Calendar

The `react-native-calendars` library is integrated for task scheduling and visualization. It displays tasks on a calendar with custom markers to indicate the presence of tasks for specific dates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Configuration

The API_BASE_URL (base URL for the API) is stored in a config.ts file for security and flexibility. This file is excluded from version control (using .gitignore) to ensure sensitive information, such as IP addresses, is not pushed to the repository.

### Steps to Configure:

1. If the file is not already present, create a new file in the src or utils folder:
   ```bash
   src/config.ts
   ```
2. Add the API URL:
   Inside config.ts, set the base URL to your local server:
   ```bash
   export const API_BASE_URL = "http://<your-ip-address>:3000";
   ```
